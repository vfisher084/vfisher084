          <p>
            [College girls often feel unsafe when using rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft because of sexual assaults and abductions committed by male drivers, which has pushed them to use unofficial services for women only. These services lack insurance, credibility, and safety that established rideshare businesses have.]
