            <h2 id="bun-info">General Bunny Information</h2>
            <p>Bunnies are often seen as simple animals that are to be kept in cages like other
                rodents such as hamsters or guinea pigs. However, <em>bunnies are actually not rodents
                at all!</em> They belong to the Lagomorpha order, due to having two pairs of upper incisors
                that rodents do not have, as well as other differing features. They are incredibly sociable
                creatures and have far more personality than you'd think. They make great companions, just
                like any dog or cat, and can be incredibly <strong class="italic">friendly</strong> and
                <strong class="italic">affectionate</strong>. They're very easy to care for, with a fairly
                simple diet and the ability to be litter-box trained. Rabbits are considered low-maintenance
                animals for the most part, although they should be attended to and loved like any other animal!
                The love you receive in return by a fluffy bunny is well worth the work.
