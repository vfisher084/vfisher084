        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>
            There are lots of different ways to make mac and cheese.
            As a cheese enthusiast myself, I eat mac and cheese very often, usually
            in its instant or boxed form to save time. However, there's just something
            special about homemade mac and cheese that gives you all those warm and fuzzy 
            feelings. It's just <em>better</em>, and <em>fresher</em>! The ingredients listed
            above are pretty much just your basic mac and cheese staples, so you can of course
            add whatever spices or extra toppings you'd like. The following recipe is one for 
            baked mac and cheese that my mom has been making for years. Let's get started!

        <h3>Preparation Instructions:</h3>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add in pasta
            of choice. Drain pasta and return to pot; add butter. Whisk together milk, evaporated milk,
            and eggs in a medium bowl. Add seasonings and salt and pepper to taste, and combine cheese 
            in a separate bowl. Place the cooked and buttered pasta in the bottom of a baking dish, 
            and sprinkle the cheese on top. Then pour the milk mixture over the pasta and cheese and bake
            35 to 45 minutes, or until the top layer is lightly browned. Let stand before serving, then enjoy!
